Pymaceuticals Inc. Analysis
	 This study was about multiple mice, which were treated with different drugs each and observed for 45 days to see the relationship between drug effect on tumor growth. However, looking at the data, there was an error observed, the same Mouse ID was allocated to two different mice, and it was essential to remove all data associated with that Mouse ID to create clean and more accurate results. The data has almost equal amount of male and female mice. Each drug regimen was observed for a minimum of 150 timepoints.
  Most significant analysis here are shown in the box plot here, final volume of Tumor treated with drugs Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Final tumor volume for Capomulin and Ramicane is significantly lower compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. This shows the Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimen can reduce tumor volume. If we see a mouse that was treated with Capomulin example shown (l909) in line plot, it shows tumor continues to grow in the initial days of drug regimen, but it drastically starts shrinking starting day 20 of the regimen.  Overall, this data suggests that some of drugs are more efficient in reducing the tumor volume.
